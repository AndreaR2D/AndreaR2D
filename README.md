# 🏋️‍♂️ Andrea R2D
`A self-training data analyst`


My data journey started with my actual position as a project manager. Since day one I had to, extract, clean and analyze data. Back then I was reling exclusively on Excel to do all this work and it was kind of... messy. But ! My natural analytical thinking was good and I knew I can sharp it. So I started to learn about data, and how I can do a professionnal analysis on my every day data. After learning Powerquery, some basic SQL, PowerBI and Statistics, I was be able to do proper reporting to my managers. 

To continue this journey, I made a choice to switching into a data analyst position. Since I'm still a project manager yet, I teach myself data analysis skills. I'm currently doing the Google Data Analyst certificate on Coursera and working on side projects to strengthen my skills.
